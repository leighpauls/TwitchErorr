This is a simple web server for a remote host that throws HTTP errors when you need them.

TwitchErorr was developed as an aid for debugging and testing transparent proxies.

It's currently written as a very simple app engine server which can only throw 500 errors, but I'd like to re-write it in node.js to throw any error type.
